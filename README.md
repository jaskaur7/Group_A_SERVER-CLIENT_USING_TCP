# SERVER-CLIENT_USING_TCP

The main purpose is to design and implement a web server and client system that can be used to transfer string of data.
In this software, the client and the server will build a communication via TCP sockets.  
The client and server will pair where server simply echoes the message or instructions that the client sends. 
Once the connection is built between client and server, we will focus on transferring the data string.
